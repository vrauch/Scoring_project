Where organizations aim to ensure fast and effective relationship management, they usually try to agree to close cooperation with their partners and suppliers, removing formal bureaucratic barriers in communication, collaboration, and decision-making. All parties in such relationships should aim for mutual transparency and visibility of the changes that may affect the other parties.

 ",,,,"I've included some prevalent budgeting models that you can use as a foundation for analysis when a client says they have a budgeting model ...

Incremental Budgeting
Incremental budgeting takes last year’s actual figures and adds or subtracts a percentage to obtain the current year’s budget.  It is the most common method of budgeting because it is simple and easy to understand.  Incremental budgeting is appropriate to use if the primary cost drivers do not change from year to year.  However, there are some problems with using the method:
- It is likely to perpetuate inefficiencies. For example, if a manager knows that there is an opportunity to grow his budget by 10% every year, he will simply take that opportunity to attain a bigger budget, while not putting effort into seeking ways to cut costs or economize.
- It is likely to result in budgetary slack. For example, a manager might overstate the size of the budget that the team actually needs so it appears that the team is always under budget.
- It is also likely to ignore external drivers of activity and performance. For example, there is very high inflation in certain input costs.  Incremental budgeting ignores any external factors and simply assumes the cost will grow by, for example, 10% this year.
- Budgets are skewed toward FIXED (CapEx) vs variable costs (OpEx)
- Compute and Storage Costs littered with sprawl due to inefficiencies with policy and continuous cost compliance
- Budgets heavily influenced by historical on-premises spend and models
- organization has a bias/approach for execution and on-going operations, but it cannot withstand scrutiny (it's very preference based)

Activity-Based Budgeting
Activity-based budgeting is a top-down budgeting approach that determines the amount of inputs required to support the targets or outputs set by the company.
- SDLC is very-well understood
- organization has experience with the cloud and its associated cost model
- organization has a plan for execution and on-going operations that can withstand scrutiny

Value Proposition Budgeting
In value proposition budgeting, the budgeter considers the following questions:
- Why is this amount included in the budget?
- Does the item create value for customers, staff, or other stakeholders?
- Does the value of the item outweigh its cost? If not, then is there another reason why the cost is justified?
Value proposition budgeting is really a mindset about making sure that everything that is included in the budget delivers value for the business. Value proposition budgeting aims to avoid unnecessary expenditures – although it is not as precisely aimed at that goal as our final budgeting option, zero-based budgeting.

Zero-Based Budgeting
As one of the most commonly used budgeting methods, zero-based budgeting starts with the assumption that all department budgets are zero and must be rebuilt from scratch.  Managers must be able to justify every single expense. No expenditures are automatically “okayed”. Zero-based budgeting is very tight, aiming to avoid any and all expenditures that are not considered absolutely essential to the company’s successful (profitable) operation. This kind of bottom-up budgeting can be a highly effective way to “shake things up”.
- The zero-based approach is good to use when there is an urgent need for cost containment, for example, in a situation where a company is going through a financial restructuring or a major economic or market downturn that requires it to reduce the budget dramatically.
- Zero-based budgeting is best suited for addressing discretionary costs rather than essential operating costs. However, it can be an extremely time-consuming approach, so many companies only use this approach occasionally.",Financial Management ,"As an organization, I need to define an overall IT Financial Management process that is integrated with the overall organizations finance and accounting functions.

 - The Metrics Dashboard will change and evolve as the Cloud Program grows  Typically the first dashboard is similar to a status report with the goal of showing the immediate scope of the cloud program.  The next iteration incorporates goals and principles of the program to measure and display status of that program. A  The last iteration of the dashboard is a comprehensive look at the current cloud environment.  To accurately communicate the progress of the cloud journey and program the team must clearly define what does success look like and how is it measured.  For enterprise speed and agility the team should start with measuring time to provision an environment per request.  As the steps and processes for that task become defined and automated the time to provision will decrease.  Breaking down each step of that process and measuring the processes flow will help determine bottlenecks and will also highlight opportunities for standardization and automation.
- Additional measurements should be included to highlight the capabilities (agility, sustainability, and speed) of the cloud team.  As new capabilities are achieved by the cloud team  these metrics can be used to highlight areas of focus for improvement an provide tangible evidence of progress towards the goal of enterprise speed and agility.

- When working to build a Great Business Case (i.e. one that is objective and compelling), research must be conducted and reasonable, and educated assumptions must be defined in order to clearly present the anticipated project benefits. While some factual, real data may be known, allowances must be made for potential variation or uncertainty. This awareness of not only the ""most likely"" results, but also the ""best-case"" and ""worst-case"" scenarios, is a crucial element in creating a Great Business Case.
Failure to clearly link and explain how each feature or characteristic of the project contributes to a specific operational effect can potentially sabotage what otherwise could have been a Great Business Case. If the business case reviewer (such as a C-Level Executive), questions the purpose or inclusion of a particular benefit, the business case builder must be able to quickly justify its operational impact (cause and effect) and how it affects the company's bottom line.
- The Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is that factor in any given Benefit, whose delta ultimately demonstrates the resultant impact from the potential project. There are several factors that are used to construct a specific benefit formula; if not clearly defined, the KPI can quickly become lost in the assumptions used in the formula of any one benefit. Identifying which factor measures the success of a particular benefit is crucial to the understanding and acceptance of a business case. Without clearly identified KPIs, executives will not have the ability to determine the validity of a specific benefit, or measure the progress of an implemented initiative.
- Often overlooked, but just as critical in developing a Great Business Case, is the ""Risk of No Investment"" outcome. If the investment is not made, what could happen to the company's bottom line? Could the  company lose customers? Or market share? Could some future costs be avoided if the investment is made today? To clearly explain all the potential risks associated with any given project, a Great Business Case must not only include the possible risks of moving forward, but must also consider the economic risk of not investing.
- A good business case provides a justification of a particular initiative or solution, often resulting in a positive return-on-investment. A project with a high ROI is great, but it is not a complete business case justification if the proposed solution does not align with the company's strategic goals. In order for a potential project to be deemed ""viable"" by a decision-making executive, it must be aligned with the company's strategic business and technology goals. A Great Business Case goes beyond simple ROI -- it demonstrates its strategic intent.",,,

Emotional Intelligence is the ability to access, express, and use one’s emotions in an efficient way. It describes having emotional self-awareness and the capacity to manage feelings by directing them toward goals. It also ensures the ability to self-motivate, suppress impulsive actions, and delay immediate satisfaction in order to achieve the goals.
Social intelligence builds on emotional intelligence. It is the capability to identify emotions of other people by not making assumptions, being empathetic, and open to co-creative actions and new ways of working in order to achieve common goals and build positive relationships. It also includes knowing and using social roles and rules, effective listening, and conversational skills.
Systems intelligence is the ability to understand, reflect upon, express, and incorporate the wider context of the system(s) a human interacts within into actions. It combines sensitivity about the environment with system thinking. In regards to the ITIL guiding principles, it is based on the ability to think and work holistically, while focusing on value, in the context of adaptive complex systems. It is the capability to see oneself as a part of a system, identify system characteristics, be aware of system rules and patterns, and be able to contribute to a system development consciously.",Multi-change Organizational Change Management,"As an organization, we need to fully understand current changes are well as pro-actively anticipate future changes.

- Every employee is fully aware of the role they play in the transformation.",,,,,"Due to the latest findings in neuroscience, technologies (such as artificial intelligence, big data, robotics, and so on), and human emotional evolution, there has been a big shift in management, leadership, and motivation approaches. These changes enable organizations to reconsider the ways organizational changes are implemented. Many of the conventional models of change management are based on obsolete ideas about human motivation and behaviour.
The OCM practice should include approaches to situations of different complexity. Organizations define the changes, the level of control, and the principles that should be addressed by the practice. Change definition considerations can be found in the change enablement practice.
An example of a set of principles that can help guide the organizational changes to be successful through designing an adaptive environment is shown below. Leaders in an organization must translate these principles to suit the specific requirements of their business if they are to achieve the target of their change.
● Clear and relevant objectives
The objectives of the change must be based on the vision and values of the organization, and clear for the stakeholders. The change must be of real value.
● Strong and committed leadership
A well-designed process uses leadership capabilities anywhere within the organization. Anyone can contribute or lead a change initiative at any stage. The potentially complex and dynamic nature of a transformation or change should be considered, and leadership should be flexible and open rather than fixed.
This practice should aim to create an environment where people may participate in change leadership as a shared practice.
● Willing and prepared participants
The employee’s strengths should be the focus. Organizations should shift from overcoming employees’ resistance towards encouraging and supporting human intellectual capital for the purpose of organizational improvement.
• Change stakeholders are valuable change agents: they can make vital contribution to an organizational transformation. People are naturally problem solvers with a unique capacity to adapt to a continually developing environment.
• Human-centred design of the OCM process. The needs and values of stakeholders should be understood.
• Map stakeholders’ and organizational values.",Dynamic Organizational Change Management,"As an organization, we consider change as an ongoing phenomenon with directions taking different turns all the time.
