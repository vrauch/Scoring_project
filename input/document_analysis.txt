Business Perspective (Generalized Key Points)Strategy and GovernanceResource Allocation: The organization has a small, specialized team managing a broad and complex technical environment, requiring strategic alignment of personnel based on expertise in different systems and components.Infrastructure Scalability: Ensuring the infrastructure can scale to accommodate new products and systems, balancing business requirements with technical limitations.Governance of Security Measures: Formalization of security policies, such as multi-factor authentication, reverse proxying, and encryption, is essential to safeguard critical business systems and maintain compliance with regulatory standards.Vendor and Licensing Management: Overlapping solutions (e.g., routers, firewalls, switches) introduce complexity in licensing, vendor support, and maintenance contracts. This requires governance structures to ensure efficient resource utilization and avoid redundancies.OperationsOperational Efficiency: Small, highly specialized teams face challenges due to the wide range of infrastructure components. Operational efficiency is critical to manage BAU tasks, system scalability, and new projects.System Complexity: Overlapping systems and devices (e.g., routers, firewalls, wireless solutions) create operational challenges that can slow down response times and increase maintenance overhead.Disaster Recovery: DR mechanisms in place for key systems (e.g., backup servers, SAN, and file systems) ensure resilience, but some systems lack high availability, risking downtime.High Availability: Not all critical systems (e.g., Citrix, File Servers) are configured for high availability, potentially risking business continuity in the event of system failures.Backup and Restoration: The backup architecture includes daily incremental and weekly full backups with long retention periods, ensuring data recovery, though some backup jobs have persistent issues (e.g., failures in replication).SecurityPerimeter Security: Network security is robust with multi-vendor solutions (Fortigate, Cisco ASA, Aruba) protecting the perimeter, but network segmentation between IT and OT remains a critical vulnerability.Endpoint Protection: Managed services like Crowdstrike protect endpoints, but some components (e.g., Veeam Backup Console) lack multi-factor authentication, exposing potential risks.Backup Security: Encryption practices are solid, but gaps like lack of immutability for Veeam backups and unscanned backup jobs for malware leave the environment vulnerable to tampering.Outdated Systems: Many systems (e.g., routers, physical servers) are out of warranty or running unsupported OS versions, introducing potential security risks from unpatched vulnerabilities.Complexity Risks: Overlapping solutions for key systems (e.g., firewalls, routers, wireless) complicate security management, increasing the risk of misconfiguration and delayed updates.DataData Protection: Data is protected via encryption (e.g., Veeam Backup), with additional layers like SAN replication, but there is a lack of comprehensive immutability and malware scanning for backup data, increasing risks of unauthorized access or corruption.Cloud Integration: Public cloud services like Office 365 and Azure are leveraged for data storage and backup, creating a hybrid environment that necessitates robust integration of cloud and on-premise solutions.Data Recovery: While disaster recovery and high availability strategies are in place for certain systems, gaps exist (e.g., file servers without high availability) that could lead to significant data loss or downtime.Database Management: SQL servers across multiple versions introduce complexity, with some servers running outdated versions, impacting both performance and security of business-critical databases.Here are the overarching challenges and risks summarized in bullet points:Vendor-Managed Systems: For several SaaS solutions, such as Basware, ProMaster, and Pronto Forms, critical infrastructure components (CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, Disaster Recovery, and High Availability) are fully managed by the vendor. This limits the client's control and visibility over system performance, disaster recovery plans, and high availability configurations.High Availability Gaps: Many systems lack High Availability configurations within the same site, leading to potential service outages when a server goes offline. Although redundancy exists across multiple sites, this still poses a risk of temporary service disruption before failover can occur.Disaster Recovery: Although disaster recovery plans are in place for many systems, they often rely on backups and replication between primary and secondary sites (e.g., Pendle Hill and Beresfield). The effectiveness of these recovery strategies is dependent on the backup systems and replication consistency, which could introduce delays in service restoration.Resource Utilization Concerns: For a few systems, resource utilization (such as CPU or memory) is exceeding healthy thresholds (e.g., ELO, Kronos, MEX). Prolonged high utilization poses risks of system performance degradation or failure, potentially impacting service availability.Complex Failover Processes: Several systems require manual intervention for failover processes, which can introduce delays in restoring services during an outage. Automated failover mechanisms are not consistently implemented across the board, leading to potential loss of service during outages.Backup Reliance: Backup strategies across various systems rely on storing copies in secondary sites, often involving HPE StoreOnce or Veeam Replication. This reliance on physical backups may introduce delays in disaster recovery if the backup systems experience failures or delays in data restoration.Multi-Site Redundancy: While many systems benefit from multi-site replication or redundancy, the lack of on-site High Availability means that localized outages can still lead to temporary service disruptions, even if other sites remain operational.Migration to Cloud Solutions: Some systems, such as Kronos, have ongoing projects to migrate to cloud-based SaaS solutions. While this may reduce infrastructure management risks, the transition period could introduce instability or additional risks during the migration process.Manual Recovery Procedures: In the absence of fully automated recovery or high availability configurations, systems often require manual recovery procedures, increasing the risk of human error and extending downtime during critical incidents.
